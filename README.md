# sendEmail Form

This code was developed for training reasons as part of the course 'JavaScript Moderno' on Udemy
In this app I am emulating a form submit with the corresponding validations. I add the differents events in case the fields validate or not.
In the email field Im using regex validation, and im making sure to enable or disable the send button in case the form is validated or not.
Also we have another button to reset the form.
